# Daily Tiny Problems

A collection of small, self-contained Python puzzles solved daily. Each file contains a short problem or might contains two or three and a concise script that solves it. The repository is designed to be easy to read and run and is just for my daily practice and incremental progress.

**Repository Goals:**
- i will just do sth tiny everyday (easy to run and understand).
- Provide simple run instructions so others can reproduce outputs quickly.

## How to run

Requirements: Python 3.8+.

From this folder, run an individual problem file with:

python Filename.py


That will execute the file and print the result to the console.


## Contributing

- Keep changes small and focused (one puzzle per commit).
- Add a short description at the top of new files explaining the puzzle.
- If you'd like to open a PR, include: brief problem description, input/output    examples, and any edge cases considered.

## License

Pick a license for your repo (e.g., MIT). If you want, I can add a `LICENSE` file for you — tell me which license to use.
